# Rust bindings for Sciter

Sciter is an embeddable [multiplatform](http://sciter.com/sciter/crossplatform/) HTML/CSS/script engine with GPU accelerated rendering designed to render modern desktop application UI. It's a compact, single dll/dylib/so file (4-8 mb), engine without any additional dependencies.

Check the [screenshot gallery](https://github.com/oskca/sciter#sciter-desktop-ui-examples) of the desktop UI examples.

Physically Sciter is a mono library which contains:

* [HTML and CSS](http://sciter.com/developers/for-web-programmers/) rendering engine based on the H-SMILE core used in [HTMLayout](http://www.terrainformatica.com/htmlayout/main.whtm),
* JavaScript alike [Scripting engine](http://sciter.com/developers/sciter-docs/) â€“ core of [TIScript](http://sciter.com/developers/for-web-programmers/tiscript-vs-javascript/) which by itself is based on [c-smile](http://c-smile.sourceforge.net/) engine,
* Persistent [Database](http://sciter.com/docs/content/script/Storage.htm) (a.k.a. [JSON DB](http://terrainformatica.com/2006/10/what-the-hell-is-that-json-db/)) based on excellent DB products of [Konstantin Knizhnik](http://garret.ru/databases.html).
* [Graphics](http://sciter.com/docs/content/sciter/Graphics.htm) module using excellent AGG library of Maxim Shemanarev at [www.antigrain.com](http://antigrain.com).
* Network communication module, it relies on [Libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/), the Great.

Sciter supports all standard elements defined in HTML5 specification [with some additions](http://sciter.com/developers/for-web-programmers/). CSS extended to better support Desktop UI development, e.g. flow and flex units, vertical and horizontal alignment, OS theming.

[Sciter SDK](http://sciter.com/download/) comes with demo "browser" with builtin DOM inspector, script debugger and documentation browser:
